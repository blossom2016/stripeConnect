Goal: Build a small web application that simulates a multi-vendor marketplace using Stripe Connect. When a customer checks out, the payment is split between the platform and the vendor.

Main Concepts:

Stripe Connect (Express/Standard accounts)

OAuth onboarding for sellers

Payment Intent + Application Fee + Transfer

Webhooks for order tracking
